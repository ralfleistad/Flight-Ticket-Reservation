# Flight-Ticket-Reservation

This my first encounter with Android Studio and making an Android application.
It is a flight reservation system which gives you the opportunity to create an account, reserve between 1-7 seats on a flight and cancel the reservation.

By logging in as the administrator with username and password "admin2" you'll be able to review the log of the app and also create new flights.
